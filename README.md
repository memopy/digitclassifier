# digitclassifier
after fucking tweaking over neural networks and some numbers i managed to get it work (in the span of fucking 1 or 2 weeks)
resources so you dont go over the suffering i have

and keep this in mind so you dont suffer like me: the weight and bias initalizations are way more important than you would expect

# accuracy
this thing gets up to %87 accuracy with test data
almost %92 with train data

# train data
https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/data
github doesnt allow me to upload the csv file so you have to download it from here
and kaggle wants you to have an account to download the dataset
and if youre gonna use this neural network make sure to put the csv file in the same directory as the .py
